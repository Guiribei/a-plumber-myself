A 42 project named Pipex that replicates the pipe UNIX mechanism


This project had two special challenges to me. Besides starting to learn how processes works on Linux (dealing with fork and execve), I had to work with a significant amount of memory allocation and string parsing. Once I didnâ€™t know how many arguments would be provided, I should code a solution that would be dynamic, and I discovered that making a non-fixed number of arguments to be handled is not a trivial task.
